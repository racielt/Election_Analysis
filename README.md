# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit.

This Colorado election analysis was done together with Tom, and the information that we are reporting is. 

- Total number of votes cast
- A list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes per candidate
- Percentage of votes per candidate
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Tomâ€™s manager wanted an automated way to get these results, normally this analysis was made through Excel.

We had three voting methods: Mail-in Ballot, Punch cards and Direct recording electronic.

After the votes were counted, we had to make a vote count report to certify the election.

This code helped us to get the vote percentage per candidate.

-	Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

Diana DeGette was the winner, with 272,892 votes, representing the 73.8% of the total.

### Election Audit Summary

This script can be used and implemented in other local elections, so the election commission get the results in a faster and reliable way.

You just have to make some changes in the code, so you can get the results you are searching for, for example, maybe you are interested in counting the voters
based on their political group.

So, you just had to add this variable and do the same analysis that you had done with candidates and counties.

Here is part of the code in where you have to start adding your new variable.

Another example, if in your data base you have the information of how the voters vote, through which voting method, you can also get that information.
